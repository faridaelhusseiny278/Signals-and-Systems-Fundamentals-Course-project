#Course Project: Signals and Systems Fundamentals
This is the description of a course project for a Signals and Systems Fundamentals course. 
The project involves using MATLAB/GNU-Octave to work with signals in the time and frequency domain, and to design Butterworth low-pass and high-pass filters.

#Project Overview
The project starts by generating four signals corresponding to the musical notes DO, RE, MI, and FA, and then creating a signal by sequentially playing these notes. 
The project then involves computing the energy and frequency spectrum of this signal, and designing a Butterworth low-pass filter that removes the MI and FA notes and a 
Butterworth high-pass filter that removes the DO and RE notes. The project also involves analyzing the output of these filters and verifying Parseval's theorem.

Finally, the project involves storing the generated signals as audio files and plotting the signals versus time t.

#Tools and Techniques
**The following tools and techniques were used in the project**:

MATLAB/GNU-Octave
Signals in time and frequency domain
Butterworth low-pass and high-pass filters
Parseval's theorem
Audio file storage
Signal plotting versus time t

#How to Run the Project
To run the project, you need to have MATLAB or GNU-Octave installed on your machine. You can then download or clone the project repository 
and run the project file in MATLAB or GNU-Octave. The instructions for running the project are provided in the project file.
